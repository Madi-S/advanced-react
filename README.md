## Index page: main content (scrollable) - showing my portfolio: skills, knowledge, about me, contacts, github repos etc. Also add overlay video somewhere

## Feedback route allows registered users to write feedback for me, however, anyone can view it: content page will look like: commentaries on the right (scrollable), my avatar and small info on the left (unscrollable)

## Login, register pages will look like small box forms on the center of the page and overlay video on the background

## Logout will simply change redux state to loggedOut and delete all user info in the local storage

## Profile page will look like a centered container (like 70% of the content size) with a editable form and submit button in order to change user info
